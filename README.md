# ODE-Simulation-GSL-Template
Template C++ Code for Simulating Ordinary Differential Equations using GSL

This code contains the basic files and functions for simulating ODEs in C++ using the GSL library.

The essentials.h header file contains a structure for the parameters, but for any long-term development, a parameters class should be used so that you can manipulate the parameters with member functions.
